        <h3>Even Styrofoams have their Kryptonite</h3>
            <p>01.07.2012</p>
            <p1>My days are now filled with more program than content. Like ordering state of the art earphones, only to receive them in a huge box filled with small, burger shaped styrofoam. I wonder if the absurd number of styrofoam burgers are calculated by multiplying the dimensions of the object by its price. The size of the box thus symbolizing the importance of the content, for the world to see to see.</p1><br><br>

            <p2>At least this is what I have concluded. I have adopted the same strategy to the precious decision I have made at this stage of my life: I have quit my job and am trying to make it on my own. My days are made up of styrofoams that buffer and protect my decision.</p2><br><br>

            <p3>I have been keeping a journal; it is called &#39;5 lines a day for 5 years&#39;. When I had a job, I struggled to find a focal point to my day. I thought hard about the underlying emotion that was key to that particular day. Now my diary resembles a to do list. To make it more fun, I challenge myself to make sentences. It is difficult to make sentences. Have you ever tried to make sentences out of a menu? It&#39;ll make your mouth water, but never give you the satisfaction of food.</p3><br><br>

            <p4>Today&#39;s list goes as follows:<br>
                Cancel my internet supplier<br>
                Have lunch with Lorenzo<br>
                Buy a bike<br>
                Drop off papers at the doctor&#39;s<br>
                Discuss project with Michele<br>
                Drinks with Jami </p4><br><br>
            
            <p5>The morning was tedious and I put myself on autopilot to go see my friend Lorenzo. We meet at the tram stop and walk the short distance to the entrance of the restaurant. From the corner of my eye I glimpse a group of four men walking our way. One in particular catches my eye; there is something about him, even from afar, that I like. As he approaches, I think &#39;definitely attractive&#39;. The color concept is just right: brown hair, big brown eyes, a particular face. They come yet closer and again I think &#39;attractive&#39;. The height, the jacket, the baseball cap.</p5><br><br>

            <p6>We are almost level now and my heart skips a beat, my brain struggles to process a piece of information that isn&#39;t coming through. We are now almost face to face and he hasn&#39;t seen me, before I can stop myself or comprehend what is happening, my mouth opens and I cry out with unrestrained glee &#39;Lukas!&#39;.</p6><br><br>

            <p7>He stops and stares, his face goes blank and I can&#39;t read him. The whole group has gathered and Lorenzo greets and chats with another member of the assembly. The other two just stare at Lukas and I, observing my fading smile and Lukas&#39; paralysis.</p7> 

            <p8>Then it hits me, yes Lukas. The Lukas who broke my heart, the Lukas who I cried over for two weeks, the Lukas the protagonist of my poem, the Lukas who dropped the polyamory bomb. The Lukas who I haven&#39;t seen in a year and a month.</p8><br><br>

            <p9>Apparently he is also the Lukas that my unconscious brain picks out of the crowd. Where I sabotage myself before my self-control can stop me.</p9><br><br>

            <p10>There is an awkward silence, until someone finally suggests we go in. We sit at separate tables, but my glance keeps wandering over to where he is sitting. Every so often I have a clear view. Every so often he has a clear view.</p10><br><br>

            <p11>As expected lunch is a relaxing matter; my voice is a little too shrill, I force myself to act jovial and make an extra effort to find things to say. Inside my head is buzzing. I would like all the phones in this room to go off at the same time. Every single person would be called away on important business. Lukas and I would be left alone.</p11><br><br>

            <p12>It&#39;s strange- we barely even knew each other. Still, I am drawn to him, I want to go over and recount all that has happened to me in this last year. I want to know what he&#39;s been doing, what he&#39;s been feeling. Where he lives and what are his plans. I&#39;ve heard he has a girlfriend. What is she like? I want to comb the year month by month and compare notes on what we&#39;ve lived separately, trying to figure out if it would have been possible to collide again.</p12><br><br>

            <p13>I want to tell him how I play the Ukulele and sing, and maybe we can jam together sometime? Just today I will be going to the bike shop to buy myself a touring bike to do long distances. Did he ever end up doing the bike tour to Greece we talked about last year? No? Ah, well any chance we can do it together this year?</p13><br><br>

            <p14>They get up and leave. He doesn&#39;t glance my way. Did I imagine it, or did he maybe for that one hour in that shared space, fantasize about being with me too? </p14>
