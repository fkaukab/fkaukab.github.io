            <p1>A few years ago I hit a psychological rough patch.<br>
                I felt alone and ashamed for being weak, when everyone else seemed to be doing fine under similar circumstances.<br>
                As I started to talk about my struggles to people around me, I realized that everyone is in pain in some form or the other.<br>
                I wondered; if pain is universal, why then do we feel so alone and isolated?</p1><br><br>
            
            <p2>We are all suffering from something. Normality is relative.</p2><br><br>
            
            <p3>I want the boundaries of sanity to be stretched a little wider, for psychological unbalances to be a little less taboo and to challenge what we believe to be &#39;socially acceptable&#39;.</p3><br><br>
            
            <p4>I write, draw, build and do numerous other things. Through these means I wish to provoke an array of emotions.<br>
                My hope is that everyone may find something to relate to.</p4><br><br>
            
            <p5>So enjoy and remember what the Cat in Alice in wonderland said: &#39;we&#39;re all mad here&#39;.</p5>
